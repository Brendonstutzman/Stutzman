     <h1>About me!</h1>
    <br>
  My name is Brendon Stutzman I’m seventeen years old and go to Lancaster High School. I am in the 12th grade taking 7 classes including a 0 period class (work experience) that I only have to go to Thursday mornings. I use to live in the neighborhood zoned for West Wind where I attended elementary school. After my fifth grade year we moved to the house I live in now in Quartz Hill where I attended sixth grade at Quartz Hill Elementary and seventh and eighth at Joe walker. The summer going into my freshman year my parents gave me the option to choose between Lancaster and Quartz Hill High school. As you can see I chose Lancaster and I’m glad I did. I have two brothers named Justin and Zach but only live with Justin (and my parents Daryl and Laura) because Zach is in the Air force overseas in South Korea.
